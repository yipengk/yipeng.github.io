After completing the freecodecamp exercises, I learned a lot about the basic syntax of Javascript. I feel that Javascript and Java have a lot of similarities in syntax, probably because they both are influenced by C syntax. I think Javascript's syntax is more concise than Java's, but syntax concise does not mean that Javascript is simpler than Java.  As statically typed language, Java has more rules, while Javascript is more flexible as a dynamically typed language. For example, in Javascript, functions are first class object, they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties, they can also be used just like any other object. I also learned ES6, the new version, through freecodecamp's exercise. A lot of new features has been added to ES6, such as the arrow function, which makes the expression of javascript functions more concise.  Also new in ES6 impressed me is the concept of destructuring, which is a way of unpacking values from an array or properties in an object into different variables. I feel that I am not very proficient in using ES6 at present, but I think I should be able to learn and use it more this semester.

For a person like me with social phobia and weak stress resistance, the pedagogy of Athletic Software Engineering made me uncomfortable.  I am introverted and afraid to talk to others. I like to be buried in the crowd, and it's best for me that no one finds me.  And when I'm nervous, my brain will shut down. (I still remember when I was a kid, my mom took me to a singing competition - I sang two lines with a shaky voice, and then I froze and completely forgot the rest of the song.) The course requires us to discuss with different groups of students every week and complete the code in a short time in class. I could already imagine the horrible moments in the classroom. But I have to admit that this method is effective because it will constantly push us to adapt to a difficult environment. Like athletes, we can constantly improve ourselves through training. I hope I can bravely step out of our comfort zone and take on new challenges.
