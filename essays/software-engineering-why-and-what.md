# Why study Software Engineering?  
Interest is the first. As an ordinary person, I can easily feel the significant changes that software engineering development has brought to my life. I can rely on software engineers' software to buy tickets, order takeout, contact my family, find jobs, go to school, get the information I want, or share ideas with different people on social media... My daily life is influenced by software engineering all the time. One day, I was suddenly curious about how this daily life happened around me, so I began my study of software engineering.
# What is Software Engineering?
Before I came to school and started my study of software engineering, my impression of software engineering was only the word software itself, but the truth was not as simple as I thought. The term software engineering, if we take it apart, is software and engineering. Software is a set of instructions and data that tell a computer or other hardware how to perform an operation. Engineering requires the use of knowledge from various disciplines, such as mathematics, to ensure that an efficient and reliable system can be designed and developed. Taken literally, software engineering seems to be a discipline that combines the theories and principles of engineering with software to improve the development and maintenance of software. But software engineering is more than just development and maintenance. As I learned from ICS314,“Classical concepts include requirements, design, implementation, testing, configuration management, development environments, quality assurance, deployment, and project management.” I think every point in this concept is important. For example, if the requirements are poorly understood, there will be problems during design and development, and later implementation and maintenance will be more difficult. That's why software engineering is important. The entire process of software development can only be effectively organized and operated to produce high-quality and reliable software projects.

# About the future
Although I have some basic programming knowledge, I know I am still in a beginner's stage. The most important thing I should do is to be a continuous learner; this is a never-ending road. Knowledge seems to be like this: when you don't know anything about it, you always feel like you already know a lot, but when you enter, you will find that when you learn more, you feel how little you know about this field. I still remember the excitement of writing code for the first time, but my memory is more about the difficulties encountered in learning and the doubts of my brain when I couldn't understand some points for a time. But anyway, I have to encourage myself to persevere because hard work does not go unrewarded. It doesn't have to be the one we initially identify, but it must be there, and I love the feeling of harvest.
