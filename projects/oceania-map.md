This is a map of Oceania that I completed with my group members in PACS108, which I am mainly responsible for painting Polynesia. On the globe, this is just a blue ocean, but in reality, there are a dozen countries and tens of thousands of islands, islands scattered like stars in the Pacific Ocean. This map allowed us to learn more about the land area of Oceania.
