This is the Oceania map my team members and I completed in PACS108. Together with another team member, I was mainly responsible for drawing Polynesia. If we look at it on a globe, this area is just a blue ocean on the globe, but in reality, a dozen countries and tens of thousands of islands are scattered like stars in the Pacific Ocean. Oceania includes three island regions: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. (Our home, Hawaii is part of Polynesia. It is the northern most extent of the Polynesian cultural region.) This map allowed us to learn more about the land area of Oceania.
