This is a map of Oceania that I completed with my group members in PACS108, which I am mainly responsible for painting Polynesia. On the globe, this is just a blue ocean, but in reality, there are a dozen countries and tens of thousands of islands, islands scattered like stars in the Pacific Ocean. Oceania includes three island regions: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Hawaii is part of Polynesia. It is the northern most extent of the Polynesian cultural region. This map allowed us to learn more about the land area of Oceania.
