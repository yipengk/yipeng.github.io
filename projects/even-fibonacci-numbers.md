  This is the second problem I have been practicing on projecteuler. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. The question asks us take the items in the Fibonacci sequence that are no more than four million and add up the even numbers. When solving the problem, we should be careful that the number in the sequence cannot exceed 4 million. Whenever a new number is generated, we must check whether the number is divisible by 2. If it is even, we add it to the sumã€‚
My code is as follows:

```javascript
let num1 = 1; //Initialize the first Fibonacci number
let num2 = 2; //Initialize the second Fibonacci number
let sum = 0;  

while (num2 < 4000000) { // The condition for this loop is when the num2 less than 4000000 
  if (num2 % 2 === 0) {  //Determine if the current num2 is even
    sum+=num2;//If it's even, adds it to the sum
    }
  let nextNum = num1 + num2;
  num1 = num2; //Update num1 to the current num2 value
  num2 = nextNum; //Update num2 to the nextNum
}

console.log(sum);
```
